Fast, resiliant, network transparent pipe tranport.

Viamillipede is client/server program built to improve pipe transport across 
networks by using multiple TCP sessions. It demultiplexes stdin into multiple 
buffered TCP connectons and then terminates the connections into stdout on 
another host. Order is guaranteed and the pipe is transparent to the source/sink
 programs.  It is as simple to use as Netcat and can generate large throughputs.
